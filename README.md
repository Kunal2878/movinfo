# MovFlix - Single Page Movie and Anime Database

Welcome to MovFlix, a single-page web application that showcases the top, most popular Foreign English Movies, Indian Movies, Animes, and Manga. This project is powered by the TMDb API for movie information and the Anilist API for anime and manga data. To enhance the user interface, I've incorporated the DaisyUI Tailwind CSS plugin and Material-UI. The project makes use of RESTful API methods to fetch and display movie, anime, and manga details. 

## Features

- **Movie Categories**: Explore popular Foreign English and Indian Movies in separate categories.
- **Anime and Manga**: Discover the world of anime and Manga with ease.
- **Detailed Information**: Get comprehensive details about each movie or anime, including cast, plot summary, and more.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for specific movies or anime titles.
- **User-Friendly Design**: The application boasts a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: This project is built on Next.js, a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering for improved performance.
- **Tailwind CSS with DaisyUI**: I utilized the DaisyUI Tailwind CSS plugin to streamline the design process and create a visually appealing user interface.
- **Material-UI**: Material-UI components were used to enhance the user experience and ensure a responsive design.
- **TMDb API**: The TMDb API provides movie details and allows us to fetch information about popular Foreign English Movies and Indian Movies.
- **Anilist API**: The Anilist API is used to fetch data about Anime and Manga, making it easy for users to explore these categories.
- **RESTful API**: RESTful API methods are employed to retrieve and display data from both TMDb and Anilist APIs.
